# Github-Battle-Game

This Github battle game app shows the most popular Github accounts (sorted by language) and allows you to compare two accounts via a battle. I learned a **MASSIVE** amount about React & functional composition whilst building this.

## Key Takeaways

1. Developed a strong understanding of React Components (passing props + state)

2. Found a new way to create buttons using Links & CSS (as opposed to HTML)

3. Learned how to map, reduce, etc. over arrays into html

4. My ability to architect code really improved (I wrote small reusable functions that each focused on ONE thing) 

## To Use

1. Download & Extract Zip

2. CD into Folder

3. Run `npm start`
